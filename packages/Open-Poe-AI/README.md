# Open-Poe-AI

Open-source, self-hosted alternative to [Poe AI](https://poe.com) — chat with multiple large language models from a single interface, on your own infrastructure.

Poe (by Quora) is a hosted aggregator that puts GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral and image/video models behind one chat UI. **Open-Poe-AI** is the self-hosted version: bring your own API keys, run it on your own server, and keep full control of prompts, conversations, and data.
